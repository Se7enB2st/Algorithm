#The Firehose Project Algorithm Challenge: Image_Blur#3

#Given an image, we want to build a method to blur the image, however instead of only blurring images that are within 1 pixel,
# we want to specify how far to blur pixels that are within a Manhattan Distance of what is specified. 

def blur(distance)
