#The Firehose Project - Algorithm Problem: Linked List 1

#A LinkedList is a node that has a specific value attached to it (which is sometimes called a payload),
#and a link to another node (or nil if there is no next item).

class Stack
    attr_reader :data
    
    def initialize
        @data = nil
    end

    # Push a value onto the stack
    def push(value)
        # IMPLEMENT ME!
    end

    # Pop an item off the stack.  
    # Remove the last item that was pushed onto the
    # stack and return the value to the user
    def pop
        # I RETURN A VALUE
    end
